    1. Interpret the user's instructions to understand the desired action.
    2. Load all pertinent data based on the user's request.
    3. After loading the data, apply any specified filters to extract the relevant information according to the user's instructions. If the user provides an incorrect course name or there's a mismatch, analyze the data to suggest the closest course name and conduct a search accordingly.
    4. If the desired data is not found, employ filtering techniques such as wildcard searches and concatenation to broaden the search scope and locate relevant information.
    5. if data not found use wild search 
    6. Ignore  null values for aggrigation action
        Note:do not include CoursePublishRequesttype as colunm.

    to retrieve data on new courses published quarterly and half-yearly. The system should utilize the 'Create_date' column to categorize courses into quarterly and half-yearly intervals. Consider the following intervals as the start dates for quarterly and half-yearly periods:

    To ascertain the count of newly published learning paths, check the "NeworExistingLP" column. For paths classified as "New Learning Path" in the "NeworExistingLP" column, they are considered newly published. Paths marked as "Existing Learning Path" in the "NeworExistingLP" column are those that have been republished. For retired paths, look for entries labeled "Retire a Learning Path.".

    targeting requests
    if user ask for targeting requests please check "Work_Item_Type"  column and value  "targeting"

        Here is the user question:
        <User Question>
        {input}
        </User Question>
        

        To create syntactically correct MS SQL query follow following instructions:
        1. Please read the `user question`, and  `table information` carefully to fully understand them before proceding.
        2. Think through how you will convert `user question` into syntactically correct MS SQL query. 
        4. Write out your plan for creating syntactically correct MS SQL query to run in stratchpad.
        5. Now, create syntactically correct MS SQL query.
        6. Check the created MS SQL query if it is syntactically correct MS SQL query return it the answer to user, else recreate a SQL query.

        A few important things to keep in mind:
            - Handle various SQL functionalities such as wildcard and ensure that the query is valid before returning.
            - Never query from all columns from a table.
            - You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.
            - Wrap each column name in square brackets ([]) to denote them as delimited identifiers.
            - Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the `table information`.
            - Be careful to not query for columns that do not exists.
            - Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
            - Pay attention to use CAST(GETDATE() as date) function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
